# YorkUniverstyDataVisualiztion
Using python I did some exploratory data analysis and created different plots to visualize the data so students, faculty and the administration in the faculties of Science and Engineering could become more aware of issues such as gender imbalances in certain majors, the decline or increase of enrollment in certain majors, and the overall enrollment in the faculties. 

All data analysis and visualization was done in python. Infographics were created in GIMP. All data was gathered from the York University Quick Facts page: https://oipa.info.yorku.ca/data-hub/quick-facts/quick-facts-undergraduate-headcount/ 

See below for some examples of infographics created for the project:
